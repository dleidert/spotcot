Description: Spot Cursor-on-Target gateway
 The spotcot gateway transforms Spot position messages into Cursor on
 Target (CoT) Position Location Information (PLI) Points for display on
 Situational Awareness (SA) applications such as the Android Team Awareness
 Kit (ATAK), WinTAK, RaptorX, et al. This allows partner agencies to track
 affiliated units without exposing existing networks, amongst other uses.
 .
 It can be run as a foreground command line application, or can be run as a
 background service using a daemon like supervisor.
 .
 Usage of this gateway requires a Spot device with service.
